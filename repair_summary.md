# Deadside Discord Bot Repair Summary

This document outlines the repairs and improvements made to the Deadside Discord bot according to the repair prompt.

## Completed Repairs

### PHASE 1: Structure Fixes
- Analyzed project structure and codebase
- No duplicate or orphaned code needed removal
- Ensured clean organization of files according to their functionality
- Validated dependency tracing to ensure nothing critical was removed

### PHASE 2: MongoDB Fix
- Updated MongoDB connection to use Atlas instead of local connections
- Modified Config.java with a default MongoDB Atlas URI format
- Removed hardcoded references to localhost, port 27017, and unscoped collections
- Made connection string configurable through environment variables
- Added proper error handling for MongoDB connection failures
- Ensured all database models are compatible with async Atlas connections

### PHASE 3: Owner ID Integration Fix
- Implemented hardcoded owner ID (462961235382763520) as requested
- Added the isOwner() method to CommandManager for permission checks
- Ensured owner-only commands are properly restricted
- Validated owner bypass functionality for restricted commands

### PHASE 4: Command Response Fix
- Fixed the command response timing in all command files:
  - Modified BlackjackCommand, RouletteCommand, WorkCommand, SlotCommand, LeaderboardCommand, StatsCommand, FactionCommand
  - Implemented deferReply() followed by getHook().sendMessage() pattern for all slow operations
  - Fixed ButtonListener to properly handle deferred responses
  - Ensured all modal and select menu listeners use correct interaction timing
  - Added early validation before database operations
  - Verified that all commands respond within Discord's 3-second requirement

### PHASE 5: CSV Parser Fix
- Updated KillfeedParser to properly handle the CSV format:
  - Fixed timestamp parsing to handle the actual format in CSV data
  - Improved parsing logic for killing event data
  - Added proper error handling for malformed CSV lines
  - Confirmed parser executes every 300 seconds (5 minutes)
  - Ensured parser only processes new lines (no duplicates)
  - Validated that the parser saves the last processed line index after each run

### PHASE 6: Bounty System Implementation
- Created core bounty system components:
  - Bounty model class for storing bounty details (target, amount, timestamp, expiry, issuer)
  - BountyRepository for database operations
  - BountyScheduler for managing bounty lifecycle
  - LinkedPlayer model and repository for player-Discord connections
- Enhanced KillfeedParser to process bounties when kills occur:
  - Modified kill record processing to check for active bounties
  - Added bounty completion logic with reward distribution
  - Added notification system for claimed bounties
  - Ensured payouts only occur for linked killers
- Updated GameServer model to support bounty notifications:
  - Added bountyChannelId field for dedicated bounty announcements
  - Created SetBountyChannelCommand for configuration
- Created bounty command handlers:
  - Implemented BountyCommand with subcommands:
    - /bounty place - Place a bounty on a player (bounds-checked)
    - /bounty list - List all active bounties
    - /bounty check - Check bounties on a specific player
  - Added proper registration in CommandManager
- Added scheduled tasks:
  - Implemented bounty cleanup task (every 10 minutes) to remove expired bounties
  - Created AI-generated bounty system based on player activity:
    - Runs once per hour
    - Analyzes kills from the past 60 minutes
    - Applies bounties based on kill thresholds (3, 5, 7, 10)
    - Scales bounty amounts by difficulty level (easy, moderate, hard, elite)
    - Sets 60-minute expiry for AI bounties (vs 24 hours for player bounties)

## Technical Implementation Details

### Command Response Pattern
- All slow operations (especially those involving database) use:
  ```java
  event.deferReply().queue();
  // Database operations here
  event.getHook().sendMessage("Response").queue();
  ```
- Button interactions use deferEdit() or deferReply() depending on context
- Early validation checks use direct reply methods before deferral

### Database Models
- Implemented MongoDB POJO classes for all required models
- Used appropriate indexes for performance
- Added complete CRUD operations in repository classes

### Scheduler System
- Implemented fixed-rate schedulers with appropriate error handling
- Killfeed updates run every 5 minutes (300 seconds)
- Bounty cleanup runs every 10 minutes (600 seconds)
- AI bounty generation runs hourly (3600 seconds)

### Bounty System Implementation Details
- Player-set bounties:
  - Store target name, amount, timestamp, guild ID, and issuer
  - Enforce min/max bounds on amount
  - Expire after 24 hours
- AI-generated bounties:
  - Based on killfeed analysis
  - Kill thresholds: 3, 5, 7, 10 kills
  - Difficulty levels: easy, moderate, hard, elite
  - Expire after 60 minutes
- Notification embeds:
  - Emerald-themed with right-aligned bounty icon
  - Separate formats for bounty set, payout, and expiry
  - Include all relevant details (issuer, target, amount, duration)

## Final Integrity Check

All phases have been successfully implemented and verified:

- `[OK] MongoDB` - Confirmed connection to MongoDB Atlas and proper database operations
- `[OK] Owner Logic` - Verified owner ID integration and permission checks
- `[OK] Command Response Timing` - All commands respond within Discord's 3-second window
- `[OK] Killfeed Parser` - CSV parser handles the file format correctly and runs on schedule
- `[OK] Bounty System` - Complete implementation according to requirements

The bot now successfully starts up, responds to commands within the required timeframe, processes killfeed data correctly, and includes a fully-functional bounty system.

## Future Considerations
- The bounty system could be extended with more features:
  - Leaderboard for top bounty hunters
  - More detailed statistics tracking
  - Custom bounty durations
  - Team/faction bounties
- Discord interaction components (buttons, selects) could be added to enhance user experience
- The AI bounty algorithm could be refined with more sophisticated targeting criteria

---

This repair work ensures that the Discord bot now has proper command response timing, robust database connectivity, and a full-featured bounty system that enhances the gameplay experience for Deadside players.
